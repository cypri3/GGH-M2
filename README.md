**GGH-M2** is an academic project focused on implementing the GGH lattice-based cryptosystem for encryption and decryption. It also includes analyzing the system's security by implementing common attacks. Built using SageMath, Python, and Jupyter, it explores key aspects of post-quantum cryptography.
